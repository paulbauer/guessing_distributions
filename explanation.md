* This app allows you to upload a dataset (".csv") and to visualize the distributions of the different variables.
<br>  
* **Using the app**
    + The aim of this app is to teach students a more intuitive understanding of distributions. Thereby, they can guess distributions and discuss them subsequently.
    + Choose different variables in the dataset.
    + Choose whether to display absolute or relative frequencies.
    + Choose whether to see 2d or 3d distributions.
    + Use your own data. It should have the format of the <a href="http://paulcbauer.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ess_ch.csv" target="_blank">default file</a>.

* The **preloaded default dataset** is a subset of the Swiss European Social Survey (ESS6e02). It contains the following variables...
    1. Trust in police = {0-10} = {not trust at all, ... , complete trust}
    1. Trust in politicians = {0-10} = {not trust at all, ... , complete trust}
    1. Political interest = {0-3} = {not at all interested, ..., very interested}
    1. Voted last election = {0, 1} = {no, yes}
    1. Party voted last election = {8 different parties}
    1. Citizenship = {0, 1} =  {no, yes}
    1. Happyness = {0-10} = {extremely unhappy, ..., extremely happy}
    1. Health = {0-4} = {very bad, ..., very good}
    1. Age = {16-96} 
    1. Household income (10 categories) = {0-9}
<br>  
* **Issues**
    + Naturally, the visualizations make sense for variables with few categories, e.g. 3d plot becomes very small when plotting age.
